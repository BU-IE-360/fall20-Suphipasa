## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```getwd()
setwd("/Users/olum_/Desktop/")
data <- read.csv(file = "multiTimeline (2).csv")
data
plot(data$X4.5g...Turkey. ,type = "l")
users <- c(4700000,
           3500000,
           3092758,
           1566171,
           2273036,
           1283234,
           1226037,
           2007491,
           1069411,
           1015779,
           594523,
           198356,
           1145156,
           -9263
           
)
plot(users, type = "l")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
